  "user_input": "This happened yesterday. I was at the mall with two of my friends, both white and girls. We were shopping at Macy's when two Asian guys walked up to us and started flirting directly with my friends. One of friends who we can call Kate is in a relationship. My second friend who we'll call Emily and I are the only single ones. The guys proceeded to ask Kate and Emily to hangout sometimes and even asked to exchange numbers. Kate informed both guys that she was already taken and told them that I'm single and free to mingle. The guy who apparently called dibs on Kate gave me an awkward look and said Yeeeea I don't think that would work out. Curious I asked what he meant by that. What he said next didn't shock me. He told me that he's looking for someone who would fit the beauty standard and would be good enough to maybe be introduced to his parents. I chuckled and said Well that's okay. I'm sure your buddy down there isn't big enough for me anyway. I pointed at his private area. The two Asian guys and my friends were all stunned by my response. I told the girls to meet me in the footwear area when they were done with the guys and walked off. Later as we were driving home Kate told me that my response was sort of immature and stereotyping and not all Asian guys have small areas. I told her that I was going to just stand there and allow the prick to insult me. She said that I can't expect every guy to find me beautiful and attractive. I told her that they don't have to find me beautiful but to stand there and insult me and make rude comments like that is something I will never stand for. The rest of the ride home was quiet. Was I wrong?",
