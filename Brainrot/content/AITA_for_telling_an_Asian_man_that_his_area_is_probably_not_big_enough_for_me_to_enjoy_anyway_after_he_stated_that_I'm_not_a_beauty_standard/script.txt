Just yesterday, I had an adventure at the mall that turned into quite the rollercoaster. I was hanging out with my two friends, Kate and Emily, browsing through Macy’s when two charming guys walked right up to us. With their smooth smiles, they began flirting with Kate and Emily. 

Now, Kate is happily taken, but my friend Emily and I are living that single life. The guys were eager, asking for numbers and suggesting hangouts, and when Kate mentioned she was off the market, she playfully nudged the guys toward me. That's when the guy who seemed to claim Kate scrambled and shot me this awkward look, followed by a surprising declaration about his dating criteria.

He basically said he was looking for someone who fits his perfect beauty standard, someone he could show off to his parents. I mean, really? Did he expect me to just take that?

So, I couldn’t help but chuckle and shot back, "Well, that’s alright. I'm sure your buddy down there isn't big enough for me anyway!" I pointed at his… area. The shock on their faces was priceless! Both of my friends gasped, hands over their mouths, while I strut away toward footwear, feeling like a boss.

Later, in the car, Kate turned to me with a raised brow. She said my comeback was a little immature, and not all Asian guys are stereotyped that way. I understood where she was coming from, but I pushed back. I said, “Look, I am not going to stand there and let him insult me without a word!” 

The drive home was filled with silence, each of us simmering—was I wrong for defending myself? Maybe it was a bit much, but hey, a girl has to stand her ground!
